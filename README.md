# Terminal Terminology

## Introduction

I've had a Linux terminal cheat sheet for years: I would add to it every time I learned a new command.  I have always thought it would be a great idea for someone to build a terminal dictionary, but also had descriptions and screenshots to go along with the terminal commands.  There are certainly sites that cover these commands, but not a site that thoroughly juxtaposes Linux commands with Windows commands. I quickly found out that Bash and the Windows command line had many different features that do not always coincide. However, I figured that I could create a website displaying basic commands. Admittedly, I had to stretch on some of the Windows commands in order to complete the site.  Iâ€™m sure you Linux nerds already knew this :).
